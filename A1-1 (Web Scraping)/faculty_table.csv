James J Weinkam,Professor Emeritus,"My main interests are in the use of special purpose languages and database techniques to solve applied problems. I am particularly interested in the area of Computational Epidemiology, the analysis of large, public heath databases for the purpose of estimating mortality and morbidity risks. My work has involved analysis of temporal trends in mortality rates and investigation of the potential biases affecting relative risk estimates and techniques for correcting for them.",https://www.sfu.ca/fas/computing/people/faculty/emeriti-faculty-members/jjw.html,
